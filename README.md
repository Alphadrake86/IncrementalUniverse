(JM) Yes, I know none of them are improtant, I was testing some things.
1. The 404 file is the error page file, its a good file to have.
2. This readme file is needed

(?) UPDATE! just did some testing. NONE of the files here are importand and can be deleted (index.html is the file that is for the webpage) test.html is just another page of the website.

(JM) Nothing to see here yet. 
The game is still an idea, so no code has been done yet.
We are expecting some programming to happen within the next couple of weeks.
